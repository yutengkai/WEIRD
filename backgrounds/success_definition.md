# Defining Success in Summarization and Partial Information Retrieval

1. **Comprehensiveness**: A successful summary or retrieved information should comprehensively represent the essential ideas or key points of the original text. It should provide a clear understanding of the original content without the need to read the full text.

2. **Accuracy**: The content should correctly reflect the facts, figures, and ideas in the original text. Any distortion or misrepresentation of the original content can undermine the success of the summarization or retrieval.

3. **Consistency**: The summary or retrieved information should maintain the original text's context. The relationships between different ideas, the sequence of events, or the cause-effect relationships should be preserved.

4. **Relevance**: Especially for information retrieval, the content that is retrieved should be most relevant to the user's query or information need. Irrelevant information reduces the success of the retrieval.

5. **Readability**: The summary or retrieved information should be easily readable, and the language should be comprehensible to the intended audience. It should be grammatically correct and maintain a logical flow of ideas.

6. **Objectivity**: The summary or retrieval should remain neutral and objective, avoiding any bias that might have been present in the original text. It should represent multiple viewpoints or perspectives if they exist in the original text.

7. **Value-Addition**: A great summary or retrieved information could provide some level of analysis, inference, or insight that adds value beyond the direct content of the original text.
